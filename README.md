# Predicting Car Prices

In this project, we'll use some of the machine learning techniques to predict a car's market price using its attributes. The chosen technique will be k-nearest neighbors algorithm developed in its univariate and multivariate models. Afterwards, another part related to the optimization of the best model obtained is executed. To do this, we'll make use of grid search techniques.
